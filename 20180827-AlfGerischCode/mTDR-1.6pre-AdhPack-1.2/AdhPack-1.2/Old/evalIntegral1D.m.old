function [a] = evalIntegral1D(g, mask, methodId)
% 
% This function evaluates the non-local term in 1D in all right
% cell end points for a periodic grid function given in the column
% vector g. The result is returned as column vector a. If g is a
% matrix then the non-local term is evaluated for each column of g
% and the results are returned in a nmatrix a.
% For the evaluation two different algorithms can be
% employed and are selected by methodId 
%   methodId == 1 ... summation based
%   methodId == 2 ... FFT-based 
% Usually, methodId == 2 is the most efficient.
% The non-local term is encapsulated in the data structure mask,
% which is created by using function setupIntegralRule1D.
