This is the README file for the Matlab TDR System, Version 1.4.
Release date: 2008, Sep 18

List of changes from Rev. 1.3 to Rev. 1.4 (2008, Sep 18)
 1 No complete change list is provided here. This is an intermediate
   version which adds some features but not everything is complete
   yet. It is however fully functional and issues error messages when
   unimplemented features are accessed.
 2 True 1D support within the mTDR system (no axisymmetry and no
   non-local terms as of yet).
 3 tdr/tdrFdgl.m is now implemented in a truly patch-wise manner which
   makes is suitable towards modular time integration. 
 4 The tdr/tdrReac.m and tdr/tdrReacV.m files are removed and their
   content is merged within the tdr/tdrFdgl.m function.
 5 The tdr/tdrGetSolutionValues.m function has been added.

List of changes from Rev. 1.2 to Rev. 1.3 (2008, Sep 08)
 1 The subdirectory AdhPack has been added to the mTDR main
   directory. It allows for the simulation of non-local terms in the
   PDE models with some restrictions: 2D only, no axisymmetry, 1 patch
   only, periodic boundary conditions. See below for further
   details. This is likely to change in further releases.
 2 tdrSetup.m (Rev. 1.0) has been added to the mTDR main directory.
   The mTDR systen can now be used following
      path(PathToTDRmainDirectory, path); 
      oldpath = tdrSetup;
 3 TDRP.grd.boundaryWidth is a new field of the grd structure
   (definition in tdrInit has been part of the data structure before
   and is removed there). 
 4 tdr/tdrComputeFaceData.m is now Rev. 1.2 because of point 3.
 5 tdr/tdrDiff.m is now Rev. 1.3 because of point 3.
 6 Introduced TDRP.tdr.have{Reaction,Diffusion,Taxis,NonLocal}Terms in
   the TDRP data structure (defined in tdrInit).
 7 tdr/tdrTaxis is now Rev. 1.3 because of points 3, 6, and the
   introduction of the non-local terms.
 8 tdr/tdrInit is now Rev. 1.1 because of points 3, 6, and the
   introduction of the non-local terms.
 9 tdr/tdrFdgl is now Rev. 1.1 because of points 3, 6, and the
   introduction of the non-local terms.
10 tdr/tdrhelp.txt is now Rev. 1.3: added not that only up to mTDR-1.2
   is described there but not the current changes!!


List of changes from Rev. 1.1 to Rev. 1.2
 - We implement the discretisation of the transport terms also for space
   dependent taxis or diffusion functions, in particular if the type of the
   transport function is DependsS or DependsSU (for the reaction function this
   has been possible already). We do not need to provide the x- and
   y-coordinates explicitly to ProbFTrans.m but instead add two parameters
   at the end of the argument list when calling ProbFTrans.m from
   tdr/tdrDiff.m, and tdr/tdrTaxis.m :
    (1) the patchId for which the transport function is to be evaluated, and
    (2) an 'x' if the transport function is to be evaluated on ALL left and
        right faces (!) of patchId or a 'y' if it is to be evaluated on ALL
        top and bottom faces of patchId. 
   Affected files are: tdr/tdrDiff.m, and 
                       tdr/tdrTaxis.m .

List of changes from Rev. 1.0 to Rev. 1.1
 - corrected computation of radial derivatives in axisymmetric case. This was
   incorrect in Rev. 1.0! 
   Affected files are: tdr/tdrComputeFaceData.m,
                       tdr/tdrDiff.m, and 
                       tdr/tdrTaxis.m .
 - added parameter inputStruct.params.rcells in model
   tdrExamples/DiffReac/ProbGetParams.m

Commands for creating the ls-alR file (to be executed one directory above 
the mTDR-version directory):

version="mTDR-1.4"
ls -alR ${version} > /tmp/ls-alR
mv /tmp/ls-alR ${version}
ls -alR ${version} > /tmp/ls-alR
mv /tmp/ls-alR ${version}
ls -alR ${version} > /tmp/ls-alR
mv /tmp/ls-alR ${version}

to check
ls -alR ${version} > /tmp/ls-alR.chk
diff /tmp/ls-alR.chk ${version}/ls-alR
rm /tmp/ls-alR.chk
